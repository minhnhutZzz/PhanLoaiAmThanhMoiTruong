W1224 22:11:11.705000 28568 site-packages\torch\onnx\_internal\exporter\_compat.py:114] Setting ONNX exporter to use 
operator set version 18 because the requested opset_version 11 is a lower version than we have implementations for. 
Automatic version conversion will be performed, which may not be successful at converting to the requested version. If 
version conversion is unsuccessful, the opset version of the exported model will be kept at 18. Please consider 
setting opset_version >=18 to leverage latest ONNX features

Error during conversion: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2705' in position 89: character maps to <undefined>

Troubleshooting:
1. Make sure PyTorch is installed: pip install torch torchvision
2. Make sure ONNX is installed: pip install onnx
3. Check if the .pth file is a valid PyTorch checkpoint
